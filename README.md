# Python_Projects

These are some projects that I had written in Python. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.
Some of the projects are created using Django.

## Projects:
- Phonebook
- File Transfer App
- Django University
- Django Checkbook
- Nice, Mean Game
- Web Page Generator

### Phonebook
This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database adn allows the user to update and delete previously stored entried.

### Django Checkbook
This project allows the user to create an account and write down their inital amount. They then can check their balance and write transactions that are either deposits or withdrawels. The app will keep track of the balance before and after the transaction and will simultaneously move them through the site to show them there balance. The user can create and delete accounts when they need to. 

### File Transfer App
This project lets the user choose to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moves will be saved in a database.

### Nice, Mean Game
This project was a basic word text game that gave the user choices to navigate through and see where they will end up. Will they end up being nice or mean? The choice is all theirs, either ending is different.
